# Differencial-Gene-Analysis

This study aims to figure out **what is highly differentially expressed genes between Banff acute T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR) and normal kidney allograft biopsy specimens**. Once we identified heightened expression of differential genes between TCMR and normal groups, we can predict the kidney transplant rejection based on recipientsâ€™ gene characteristics. 

The RNA-seq expression values file **GSE131179_RAW** was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131179), which is a subset of kidney allograft recipients transplanted and followed at our center. We found data is RPKM measure instead of raw read count data.
