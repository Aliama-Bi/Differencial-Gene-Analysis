From topTable **tT**, we can access information:
  
  - `logFC: log2 fold change of TCMR/Normal,gives the value of the contrast`
- `AveExpr: Average expression across all samples, in log2 CPM`
- `t: logFC divided by its standard error`
- `P.Value: Raw p-value (based on t) from test that logFC differs from 0`
- `adj.P.Val: Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate adjusted p-value`
- `B: log-odds that gene is DE (arguably less useful than the other columns)`
